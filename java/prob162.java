/*
162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

class Solution 
{
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) 
    {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length - 1;
        while (start < end) 
        {
            int middle = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (nums[middle] > nums[middle + 1]) 
                end = middle;
            else 
                start = middle + 1;
        }
        
        return start;
    }
}
